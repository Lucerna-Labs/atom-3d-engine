**Wiring:** fusion ranking
**Cross-domain:** agentic-reasoning → combinatorial-optimization → cryptography-advanced → formal-verification → statistics-probability
**Components:**
  - bayesian-posterior-inference (statistics-probability): Bayesian inference: compute posterior p(θ | x) = p(x | θ)·p(θ) / p(x). Prior p(θ) encodes domain knowledge; posterior combines data + prior; predictive posterior p(x_new | x) = ∫ p(x_new | θ)·p(θ | x) dθ.
  - chain-of-thought (agentic-reasoning): Chain-of-Thought (CoT): generate intermediate reasoning steps before final answer. "Let's think step by step." Implicit vs. explicit CoT; generated vs. retrieved CoT.
  - computation-tree-logic (formal-verification): CTL: branching-time temporal logic with path quantifiers (A = all paths, E = exists path) and temporal operators (X = next, F = eventually, G = always, U = until, W = weak until). Model checking: labeling algorithm.
  - integer-programming (combinatorial-optimization): IP (Integer Programming): optimization over integer variables with linear constraints. NP-hard in general; branch-and-bound solves practically.
  - maximum-likelihood-estimation (statistics-probability): MLE: choose parameter θ to maximize likelihood L(θ; x) = P(x | θ). Equivalently maximize log-likelihood ℓ(θ; x) = Σ log P(xᵢ | θ). Consistent (as n → ∞) and asymptotically efficient (lowest variance among unbiased estimators).
  - pedersen-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Pedersen commitment: commit to m as C = g^m · h^r, where g, h are generators of a group of unknown order, and r is randomness. Perfectly hiding (given m, g^r is uniform) and computationally binding under the discrete log assumption.
**Real walls (combined):**
  - [bayesian-posterior-inference] Prior sensitivity: posterior can be prior-dominated if data is sparse
  - [bayesian-posterior-inference] Jeffreys prior = uninformative
  - [bayesian-posterior-inference] conjugate priors simplify
  - [chain-of-thought] CoT effectiveness plateaus for >5–7 steps
  - [chain-of-thought] self-consistency (sample multiple CoTs, vote) improves accuracy at cost O(n·k)
  - [computation-tree-logic] Expressive enough for many properties
  - [computation-tree-logic] CTL cannot express some properties (e.g., "always eventually p holds on all paths" = AG EF p)
  - [computation-tree-logic] CTL* (full branching time) is more expressive
  - [integer-programming] Problem formulation (modeling) quality matters more than solver
  - [integer-programming] different formulations have vastly different solving times
  - [maximum-likelihood-estimation] Non-convex likelihoods → multiple local maxima
  - [maximum-likelihood-estimation] flat likelihood → high variance
  - [maximum-likelihood-estimation] regularization may be needed
