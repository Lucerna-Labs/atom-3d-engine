```
**Wiring:** fusion ranking
**Cross-domain:** agentic-reasoning → combinatorial-optimization → cryptography-advanced → formal-verification → networking
**Components:**
  - branch-and-cut (combinatorial-optimization): Branch-and-cut: B&B + cutting planes added at nodes. Cuts tighten LP relaxation without removing integer solutions.
  - bulm-model-checking (formal-verification): Bounded Model Checking (BMC): unroll the state transition system for k steps and check if a property violation (counterexample) exists in ≤ k steps. Encode as SAT or SMT formula: ¬φ at step k.
  - chromatic-dispersion (networking): Wavelength-dependent propagation velocity causing pulse broadening: Δτ = D·L·Δλ.
  - computation-tree-logic (formal-verification): CTL: branching-time temporal logic with path quantifiers (A = all paths, E = exists path) and temporal operators (X = next, F = eventually, G = always, U = until, W = weak until). Model checking: labeling algorithm.
  - graph-of-thought (agentic-reasoning): Graph-of-Thought (GoT): model reasoning as DAG; nodes = reasoning units (thought, fact, conclusion); edges = dependencies; supports non-linear, cyclic, and self-referential thought.
  - merkle-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Merkle commitment: hash data into a binary tree, commit to root hash; opening = path of sibling hashes to root. Post-quantum secure (only requires collision-resistant hash).
  - pedersen-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Pedersen commitment: commit to m as C = g^m · h^r, where g, h are generators of a group of unknown order, and r is randomness. Perfectly hiding (given m, g^r is uniform) and computationally binding under the discrete log assumption.
  - program-aided-language-model (agentic-reasoning): PAL (Program-Aided Language Model): LLM generates executable code to solve reasoning tasks; code executor computes result; LLM interprets output.
**Real walls (combined):**
  - [branch-and-cut] Cut selection: too many cuts = expensive LP solves

  - [chromatic-dispersion] D (ps/nm/km) varies with fiber type
  - [chromatic-dispersion] uncompensated dispersion limits bit rate × distance product
  - [computation-tree-logic] Expressive enough for many properties
  - [computation-tree-logic] CTL cannot express some properties (e.g., "always eventually p holds on all paths" = AG EF p)
  - [computation-tree-logic] CTL* (full branching time) is more expressive
  - [graph-of-thought] Cycle detection and handling
  - [graph-of-thought] graph consistency maintenance

**Wiring:** fusion ranking
**Cross-domain:** agentic-reasoning → combinatorial-optimization → cryptography-advanced → formal-verification → networking → statistics-probability
**Components:**
  - branch-and-cut (combinatorial-optimization): Branch-and-cut: B&B + cutting planes added at nodes. Cuts tighten LP relaxation without removing integer solutions.
  - chromatic-dispersion (networking): Wavelength-dependent propagation velocity causing pulse broadening: Δτ = D·L·Δλ.
  - linear-temporal-logic (formal-verification): LTL: temporal logic over single execution path; operators: X (next), U (until), R (release), F (finally), G (globally). Encodes ω-regular properties. Safety (G ¬bad), liveness (F good), fairness (GF can).
  - maximum-likelihood-estimation (statistics-probability): MLE: choose parameter θ to maximize likelihood L(θ; x) = P(x | θ). Equivalently maximize log-likelihood ℓ(θ; x) = Σ log P(xᵢ | θ). Consistent (as n → ∞) and asymptotically efficient (lowest variance among unbiased estimators).
  - merkle-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Merkle commitment: hash data into a binary tree, commit to root hash; opening = path of sibling hashes to root. Post-quantum secure (only requires collision-resistant hash).
  - pedersen-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Pedersen commitment: commit to m as C = g^m · h^r, where g, h are generators of a group of unknown order, and r is randomness. Perfectly hiding (given m, g^r is uniform) and computationally binding under the discrete log assumption.
  - polynomial-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Commitment to a polynomial f(x) = Σ aᵢxⁱ such that later the committer can prove statements about f at arbitrary points without revealing the full polynomial. KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) uses trusted setup + pairing.
  - program-aided-language-model (agentic-reasoning): PAL (Program-Aided Language Model): LLM generates executable code to solve reasoning tasks; code executor computes result; LLM interprets output.
