**Wiring:** fusion ranking
**Cross-domain:** agentic-reasoning → combinatorial-optimization → cryptography-advanced → formal-verification
**Components:**
  - bdd-symbolic-model-checking (formal-verification): Binary Decision Diagram (BDD): canonical representation of Boolean functions; ROBDD = reduced ordered BDD (unique canonical form). BDD-based symbolic model checking uses BDDs to represent state sets and transition relations.
  - branch-and-cut (combinatorial-optimization): Branch-and-cut: B&B + cutting planes added at nodes. Cuts tighten LP relaxation without removing integer solutions.
  - fiat-shamir-heuristic (cryptography-advanced): Transform an interactive sigma protocol into a non-interactive proof: replace verifier's random challenge c with H(a || transcript), where H is a cryptographic hash. Prover generates c = H(a) then z without verifier interaction.
  - polynomial-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Commitment to a polynomial f(x) = Σ aᵢxⁱ such that later the committer can prove statements about f at arbitrary points without revealing the full polynomial. KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) uses trusted setup + pairing.

  - react-reasoning-acting (agentic-reasoning): ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): interleave thought steps with tool actions; thought = reason about situation; action = call tool; observation = tool result; repeat until done.
