  - bdd-symbolic-model-checking (formal-verification): Binary Decision Diagram (BDD): canonical representation of Boolean functions; ROBDD = reduced ordered BDD (unique canonical form). BDD-based symbolic model checking uses BDDs to represent state sets and transition relations.
  - cutting-planes (combinatorial-optimization): Cutting planes: valid inequalities that cut off fractional LP solutions. Gomory mixed integer (GMI), MIR, lift-and-project.
  - merkle-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Merkle commitment: hash data into a binary tree, commit to root hash; opening = path of sibling hashes to root. Post-quantum secure (only requires collision-resistant hash).
  - pedersen-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Pedersen commitment: commit to m as C = g^m · h^r, where g, h are generators of a group of unknown order, and r is randomness. Perfectly hiding (given m, g^r is uniform) and computationally binding under the discrete log assumption.
  - polynomial-commitment (cryptography-advanced): Commitment to a polynomial f(x) = Σ aᵢxⁱ such that later the committer can prove statements about f at arbitrary points without revealing the full polynomial. KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) uses trusted setup + pairing.
  - program-aided-language-model (agentic-reasoning): PAL (Program-Aided Language Model): LLM generates executable code to solve reasoning tasks; code executor computes result; LLM interprets output.
